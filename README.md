# SOUQ Project WebApp By Django
### First Project In Django For Me

Is A Website That User Can Enter It Without Login And Show All Products
With Image And Price 
He Can Order Any Product, He Want to Put The Number of Meters He Need And It Will Calculate The Total Cost For Him, And After That He Will Enter His Phone Number, Then One From Admins Will Phone Him To Confirm The Order And Get First Deposit

Admin Can Login In Admin Panel -> It's Django Admin Panel, Then Can Add and Delete Or Edit Any Product

Will See All Orders And Can Cancel Any of Them If It Finished

This The First Real Django Project For Me, That I create It Without Any Tutorial In 9 Days in 2020

I Download It Agian and Add This README file, and Solve Some Errors

It Still Not Efficient at all but, i'm still  proud for my self that i create it without good learning for web devolpement at all

Now I Learn Backend, And Create With Django And More than Tech. A lot of Projects, And with A Lot Of Problems Faced Me, but we Solved it.
